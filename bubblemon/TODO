To Emacs: This is a -*-text-*- file.

This list is not really sorted, but stuff higher up on the list will
tend to be completed earlier than stuff towards the end.  If you want
something on this list done quickly, I've provided some pointers to
get you started.  Questions?  Send 'em to me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se).

. Translate the applet into every single language in existance.  If
 the applet doesn't show up in your favourite language even though
 other parts of your GNOME desktop does, read the TRANSLATIONS file
 for instructions on how to translate it.  This does not require any
 programming skills, and should be a both easy and useful way to
 improve the applet.

. If lots of memory is used, add the text "Process 4711 "mozilla" is
using 42Mb" to the tool tip.  The process mentioned should be the one
using the highest amount of memory.

. If lots of CPU is used, add the text "Process 4711 "mozilla" is
using 100% CPU" to the tool tip.  The process mentioned should be the
one using the largest amount of CPU.
 
. On Linux 2.4 systems, inode cache memory is reported as water
 instead of air.  This should be fixed.  This may require changing
 libgtop.

. Add a "Legend" to the right mouse button menu.

. Run 'gtop' if the user clicks the applet.

. Pause the applet if it ain't visible for some reason (for example if
 the GNOME panel is hidden).

. Fix the bubblemon.spec file (that describes what should go into the
 RPM) so that it makes 'root' own all files (instead of 'johan'...).

. Make the applet look more like a glass vial.  Perhaps by drawing a
 vial outline, and making the bubbles transparent instead of
 air-colored?  Drawing takes place inside bubblemon.c below the
 comment saying "Draw the air-and-water background".

. Add a pointer to where the FAQ is located to the About box.  Is this
 at all possible to do in some way that survives all different kinds
 of packaging formats?

. Make the configure script check for if we are running on a Linux 2.2
 system.  If that's the case, check memory usage a lot more seldom.

. Add a message in a bottle that drops from the sky when new mail
 arrives.  After mail has been read, the bottle should sink out of the
 vial.  The bottle should only appear if the applet is big enough.
