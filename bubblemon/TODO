To Emacs: This is a -*-text-*- file.

This list is not really sorted, but stuff higher up on the list will
tend to be completed earlier than stuff towards the end.  If you want
something on this list done quickly, I've provided some pointers to
get you started.  Questions?  Send 'em to me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se).

. Translate the applet into every single language in existance.  If
 the applet doesn't show up in your favourite language even though
 other parts of your GNOME desktop does, read the TRANSLATIONS file
 for instructions on how to translate it.  This does not require any
 programming skills, and should be a both easy and useful way to
 improve the applet.

. Follow resize hints from the GNOME 1.2 panel.  If you know about or
 want to learn how to make nice GNOME 1.2 compliant panel applets,
 this one is for you.  You should probably connect some additional
 signals to the applet in the make_new_bubblemon_applet() function in
 bubblemon.c, put the new size in bm->breadth and bm->depth, and call
 the bubblemon_set_size() function to resize the applet.

. Stop the applet if it ain't visible for some reason (for example if
 the GNOME panel is hidden).  If you know about or want to learn how
 to make nice GNOME 1.2 compliant panel applets, this one is for you.
 You should probably connect some additional signals to the applet in
 the make_new_bubblemon_applet() function in bubblemon.c and add some
 variable that is checked at the beginning of bubblemon_update() to
 see whether the applet should be updated or not.
 
. Make bubble movement independent of update frequency.  If you know
 about or wish to learn about how to make real time visualizations of
 physical phenomenon, this one is for you.  You should probably modify
 the code around the "Move the bubble vertically" comment in
 bubblemon.c for doing this.

. Make a properties box using Glade/libGlade?  In that case, make the
 properties box contain four color options and options for changing
 the update frequency.  Have everything saved / restored by the
 session handling code.  If you want to look into this, a good start
 would be reading the libGlade docs at
 "http://developer.gnome.org/doc/API/libglade/libglade.html".  If you
 want to learn how to easily write GUIs for GNOME, this one is for
 you.

. For some (but not all) people with 24 bit displays, the applet won't
 work.  For this reason, the color handling should be re-written.  If
 you want to look into this, the function bubblemon_setup_colors() in
 bubblemon.c should be re-written.  Also, the last lines of
 bubblemon_update() in bubblemon.c (below the comment about "drawing
 magic") should be re-written.  Currently, 96 colors are allocated to
 begin with, and depending on swap load three of them are used for
 drawing the applet at any time.  The way it should be done (if that's
 possible, I don't know) is to allocate three colors, and use them for
 drawing all the time.  These three colors should then be modified
 according to the current swap load.  If you know about, or want to
 learn about GTK+ color handling, this one is for *you*.

. When the applet gets a properties box, make it run some configurable
 command line when clicked.

. Make the applet look more like a glass vial.  Perhaps by drawing a
 vial outline, and making the bubbles transparent instead of
 air-colored?  Drawing takes place inside bubblemon.c below the
 comment saying "Draw the air-and-water background".

. Fix the GTK+ bug 15891 (http://bugs.gnome.org/db/15/15891.html).
 The applet_widget_set_widget_tooltip() function erroneously hides the
 tooltip if it is visible when applet_widget_set_widget_tooltip() is
 called.

. Fix the performance problems that glibtop are having with swap space
 measurement and with memory measurement on (some?) systems with >=
 128Mb memory.  Useful if you have this much memory.
