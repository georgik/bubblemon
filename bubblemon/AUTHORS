AUTHORS:

Main author: Johan Walles <d92-jwa@nada.kth.se>

Thanks to Harri Haataja for fixing the RPM spec.

Thanks to Pete Rijks and Florian Hinzmann, who helped me find the very
annoying segfault.

Thanks a lot to Nathan "Nato" Uno for reviewing my code, finding lots
of errors, writing the larger-bubbles patch, making a bunch of
performance enhancements, and for probably doing at least one more
thing that I have currently forgotten about.

Thanks to Bernd Eckenfels for adding Debian packaging stuff.

Thanks to Thomas McGuffey for working around the GTK+ tooltip bug, and
for finding a problem with get_censored_memory_and_swap().

Thanks to Justin McAleer for providing me with my first actual lead to
what may be causing the performance problems some people are having.
