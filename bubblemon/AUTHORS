AUTHORS:

Main author: Johan Walles <d92-jwa@nada.kth.se>

Thanks to Harri Haataja for fixing the RPM spec.

Thanks to Pete Rijks and Florian Hinzmann, who helped me find the very
annoying segfault.

Thanks a lot to Nathan "Nato" Uno for reviewing my code, finding lots
of errors, writing the larger-bubbles patch, making a bunch of
performance enhancements, and for probably doing at least one more
thing that I have currently forgotten about.

Thanks to Bernd Eckenfels for adding Debian packaging stuff.

Thanks to Thomas McGuffey for working around the GTK+ tooltip bug, and
for finding a problem with get_censored_memory_and_swap().

Thanks to Justin McAleer for providing me with my first actual lead to
what may be causing the performance problems some people are having.
This also lead to me actually tracking it down to problems with
checking the amounts of used memory and swap.  At first I thought the
problem was with glibtop, but then "timecop" informed me that the
problem is with Linux 2.2 and not glibtop.  Also, "timecop" claimed
that these problems should be fixed (or at least not as visible) by
2.4.

Thanks to Leandro Fanzone for fixing the applet so that it can be
displayed on remote X displays.

Thanks to Alex Badea for writing a workaround for the need for the
--activate-goad-server switch.

Thanks a lot to Charles Gales for adding initial SMP support.

Thanks to Detlef Reichl for the icon support.

Thanks a lot to Benjamin Smith for implementing 24bpp support, this
has been a problem since way back.
