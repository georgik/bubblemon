.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP 
This GNOME applet displays the system load in the form of a bubbling liquid.
The surface level corresponds to the amount of memory used by the system,
a high surface level means that lots of memory is in use.  The amount of
bubbles indicates the system load, lots of bubbles means a high system load.
Finally, the color of the liquid indicates the amount of swap space used.
As long as the liquid is water colored no swap is being used, but as more
swap is used the liquid turns redder.

If you want exact figures, there is a tooltip that pops up if you hover your
mouse pointer over the applet for a second.
