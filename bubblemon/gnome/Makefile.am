# FIXME: This file should tell automake to include the files
# bubblemon_applet.desktop and bubblemon_applet.gnorba in the
# distribution, and that they on 'make install' should be installed in
# sysconfdir/CORBA/servers/bubblemon_applet.gnorba and
# datadir/applets/Monitors/bubblemon_applet.desktop
