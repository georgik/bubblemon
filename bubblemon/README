TODO:

. Glade-ify the properties box?
. Make the properties box contain four color options, and have them
 saved / restored by the session handling code.
. Make bubble movement independent of update frequency
. automake/autoconf-ify the sources.
. Gettextify the applet and translate stuff into Swedish
