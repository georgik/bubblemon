TODO:

. Fix the applet tooltip.  The tooltip currently disappears for me
 every time it is updated, and it is updated every time the mouse
 pointer enters the applet.  This combination currently makes the
 tooltip permanently invisible.  If you could tell me
 (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) why, I'd appreciate it a lot!  Something should
 probably be added to the call to applet_widget_set_tooltip() within
 the update_tooltip() function, but I have absolutely no idea what.
 HELP!!

. Get the applet working on 24 bit displays.

. Make bubble movement independent of update frequency

. Gettextify the applet and translate stuff into Swedish

. Make a properties box using Glade?  In that case, make the
 properties box contain four color options and options for changing
 the update frequency.  Have everything saved / restored by the
 session handling code.

. Follow resize hints from the GNOME 1.2 panel
