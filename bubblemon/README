TODO:

. Add a hint to the applet, showing the current system load in numbers
. Make the bubbles more visible (how?)
. Make bubble movement independent of update frequency
. Gettextify the applet and translate stuff into Swedish
. Make a properties box using Glade?  In that case, make the
 properties box contain four color options, and have them saved /
 restored by the session handling code.
