TODO:

. Make liquid flow in and out when memory usage changes, instead of
 (like now) just changing the water level.  Do it by having an
 individual water level for each column.  The outermost columns will
 reflect the current memory usage, and changes in memory usage will
 propagate to the inner columns by setting all water levels to the
 average between the column to the left of this one, and the level to
 the right of this one.
. Glade-ify the properties box?
. Make the properties box contain four color options, and have them
 saved / restored by the session handling code.
. I like borders.  Put a border 'round the applet.
. Make bubble movement independent of update frequency
. automake/autoconf-ify the sources.
