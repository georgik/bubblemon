Installing The Bubbling Load Monitoring Applet ("bubblemon" for short)



In order to install bubblemon, follow this simple guide.


Install (from tar.gz)

  1. Untar the tarball somewhere, and cd into the new directory created

     tar xzvf bubblemon-2.0.0.tar.gz
     cd bubblemon-2.0.0

  2. Compile it

     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make

  3. Install it. You need to have root privileges to do this

     su
     [enter root password]
     make install

  4. Finally you need that the panel refresh it's own configuration. 
     You can look for the panel process id and send to the process a SIGHUP to i
     reread the file, or you can logout and the login again ( easier :) ).

  5. Right-click some free spot on any GNOME panel.  Choose
     Add to Panel->Utility->Bubblemon.


Build a rpm package (from src.rpm)

Since is difficult to maintain rpm binaries for all the distros, actually to 
create a rpm for your platform you need to follow these steps. Please note that
you may need root privileges to do this.


  1. Rebuild the rpm package from sources

     rpm --rebuild  bubblemon-2.0.0-2.src.rpm

  2. Install the generated package 

     rpm --install /usr/src/redhat/RPMS/i386/bubblemon-2.0.0-2.i386.rpm
   
  3. Finally you need that the panel refresh it's own configuration. 
     You can look for the panel process id and send to the process a SIGHUP to i
     reread the file, or you can logout and the login again ( easier :) ).

  4. Right-click some free spot on any GNOME panel.  Choose
     Add to Panel->Utility->Bubblemon.
