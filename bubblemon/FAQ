1. The program crashes.  What should I do?

Either fix it yourself and send me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) a patch, or
send me a bug report.  The bug report should contain the result of
changing directory into the bubblemon directory and doing the
following:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ cd src
$ gdb bubblemon_applet
(gdb) run --activate-goad-server=bubblemon_applet
<SEGFAULT>
(gdb) info stack

2. Performance sucks.  What should I do?

See the file PROFILING for instructions on finding out where your
cycles go.  Then, either fix it yourself and send me
(d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) a patch, or send me a bug report containing the
output of the commands recommended in PROFILING.

3. The program doesn't do anything; it doesn't even crash!

Try running it from the command line, and see if you get an error
message.  Do the follwing from the bubblemon directory:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ src/bubblemon_applet --activate-goad-server=bubblemon_applet

4. I have another question/problem.  What should I do?

E-mail me at d92-jwa@nada.kth.se and ask ahead.
