1. The program crashes.  What should I do?

Either fix it yourself and send me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) a patch, or
send me a bug report.  The bug report should contain the result of
changing directory into the bubblemon directory and doing the
following:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ cd src
$ gdb bubblemon_applet
(gdb) run --activate-goad-server=bubblemon_applet
<SEGFAULT>
(gdb) info stack


2. Performance sucks.  What should I do?

To give you some frame of reference of what kind of performance to
expect; on my 400MHz PII system I have never seen the bubblemon go
over 1.5% CPU utilization (according to 'top').

See the file PROFILING for instructions on finding out where your
cycles go.  Then, either fix it yourself and send me
(d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) a patch, or send me a bug report containing the
output of the commands recommended in PROFILING.


3. The program doesn't do anything; it doesn't even crash!

Try running it from the command line, and see if you get an error
message.  Do the follwing from the bubblemon directory:

$ ./configure
$ make
$ src/bubblemon_applet --activate-goad-server=bubblemon_applet


4. Isn't the applet supposed to have a tooltip?  Where is it?

Yes it is and the code is there for it.  See the README file under the
TODO section for more info.


5. I have another question/problem.  What should I do?

E-mail me at d92-jwa@nada.kth.se and ask ahead.
