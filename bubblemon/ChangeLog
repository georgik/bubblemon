	category used previously seems deprecated.

2007-08-26  Johan Walles  <johan@localhost.localdomain>

	* Fix SMP detection code.  Has been broken since dackefejden.

	* Give each CPU some space of its own on the bubble display.  The
	CPU with the heaviest load gets to bubble in the middle.  CPUs
	with lower load bubbles nearer to the edges.  The idea is to make
	it possible to see not only how loaded the system is, but also how
	the load is distributed between different CPUs.

	* Update the Polish translation, courtesy of Tomasz Dominikowski.

	Medeiros.
