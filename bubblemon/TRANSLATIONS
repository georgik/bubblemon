To Emacs: This is a -*-text-*- file.

This file will tell you how to translate the applet into your
favourite language.

1. Find out your language code from
  "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/languages.html".  In the
  following examples, we will be using "xx" for the language code, so
  where ever you see xx, you should replace it with the code for your
  favourite language.

2. Create the template file (more on this later) by doing...

  ./configure
  make

  ... from the bubblemon directory.

3. Enter the 'po' directory:

  cd po

4. Initialize your translation by copying bubblemon.pot into xx.po
   (but use *your* language code instead of xx):

  cp bubblemon.pot xx.po

5. Edit xx.po using your favourite text editor:

  emacs xx.po

6. When you have translated everything in that file, mail it to me
   (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) for inclusion in the next version.

7. If you want to see your newly created translation in action, edit
   configure.in in the bubblemon directory, and add your language to
   the ALL_LINGUAS variable.  This is what the ALL_LINGUAS line should
   look like if there are translations for Swedish and xx:

  ALL_LINGUAS="sv xx"

8. Run autoconf, build and install the project:

  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  su
  [enter the root password]
  make install
  exit

The applet should now appear in the language of your choice!  If you
have any opinions on this short howto, do send me an e-mail at
d92-jwa@nada.kth.se and voice your opinion.
