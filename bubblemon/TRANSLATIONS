To Emacs: This is a -*-text-*- file.

This file will tell you how to translate the applet into your
favourite language.  No programming skills are required for this, and
if you need any help with this, please let me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se)
know.

1. Find out your language code from
  "http://www.unicode.org/unicode/onlinedat/languages.html".  In the
  following examples, we will be using "xx" for the language code, so
  where ever you see xx, you should replace it with the code for your
  favourite language.

2. To translate the GNOME panel menu entry, open the file
  gnome/bubblemon_applet.desktop in your favourite editor, and just
  add your translations to the others (if you look at the file, it
  should be obvious).  Use the language code from step one (above).
  Mail the result to me (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se).

3. Create the template file by doing...

  ./configure
  make

  ... from the bubblemon directory.

4. Enter the 'po' directory:

  cd po

5. Initialize your translation by copying bubblemon.pot (the template
  file created in step 3) into xx.po (but remember to use *your*
  language code instead of xx):

  cp bubblemon.pot xx.po

6. Edit xx.po using your favourite text editor.  Leave the lines
  containing English (marked "msgid") alone; your translations should
  be added under the "msgstr" heading.  If you are unsure, look at
  some other translation (sv.po for example) to see how it's done.
  Here we go:

  emacs xx.po

7. When you have translated everything in that file, mail it to me
   (d92-jwa@nada.kth.se) for inclusion in the next version.

8. If you want to see your newly created translation in action, use
   your favourite text editor to edit configure.in in the bubblemon
   directory, and add your language to the ALL_LINGUAS variable.  This
   is what the ALL_LINGUAS line should look like if there are
   translations for Swedish and xx:

  ALL_LINGUAS="sv xx"

9. Run autoconf, build and install the project:

  autoconf
  ./configure
  make
  su
  [enter the root password]
  make install
  exit

The applet should now appear in the language of your choice!  If you
have any opinions on this short howto, do send me an e-mail at
d92-jwa@nada.kth.se and voice your opinion.
