If performance sucks, try this from the bubblemon directory:

./configure --enable-profiling
make clean ; make
cd src
./bubblemon_applet --activate-goad-server=bubblemon_applet
[use your system "normally" for roughly one minute, until bubblemon terminates]
gprof -l -p ./bubblemon_applet ~/gmon.out

This will tell you on what lines the program spends most of its time.

To find out which functions take the most time, try:

gprof -p ./bubblemon_applet ~/gmon.out

Happy profiling!
