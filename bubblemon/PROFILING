If performance sucks, try this from the bubblemon directory:

./configure --enable-profiling
make clean ; make
cd src
./bubblemon-gnome1
gprof -l -p ./bubblemon-gnome1 ~/gmon.out

The output from the last command will tell you on what lines the
program spends most of its time.

To find out which functions take the most time, try:

gprof -p ./bubblemon-gnome1 ~/gmon.out

Happy profiling!
