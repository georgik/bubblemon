# The following line is a workaround for a problem with gettext.

# The following line is what *should* be used if the gettext
# Makefile.in would be working like the Makefile.ins generated by
# automake.  The problem has already been reported to the Debian bug
# tracking system under numbers #38414, #41823 and #52571.  Actually,
# those bugs have now been fixed, but since the above syntax still
# works I'll just leave it alone.
