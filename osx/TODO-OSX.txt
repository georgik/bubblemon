TODO
----
* If the Dock is at the bottom of the screen at installation, we
  should move it to the left, no questions asked.

* If the user moves the Dock to the bottom, we should replace
  ourselves with a crossed over static bubblemon image. Then, if the
  user clicks us, we bring up a dialog offering to move the Dock back
  to the left.

* Enable easy upgrades. If some other Bubblemon is running in the
  Dock, we should replace it with ourselves.

* Dock performance is about 4x worse when having the Dock at the
  bottom of the screen compared to running with the Dock to the left
  or right. At first start, before killing the Dock, we should ask if
  people want their Dock to the left, to the right, or not installing
  Bubblemon. Running it at the bottom of the screen will take too much
  CPU.

* Think about making the frame thinner; would that look better?

* Make a 1024x1024 app icon. That's a requirement for App Store
  release, and while releasing to App Store won't be possible we
  should follow their guidelines as well as we can. The icon should
  show up in the About box and when you look at Bubblemon.app in
  Finder.

* Think about using NSDefaults to query the Dock about our tile
  size. Maybe not every frame (for performance reasons), but every
  five seconds or so.


DONE
----
* Point the old web page to http://walles.github.io/bubblemon.

* Make sure http://walles.github.io/bubblemon has a link to
  https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases.

* Release zip files should go into ~/Downloads.

* Unzipping bubblemon-osx-1234.zip should give you the app in
  bubblemon-osx-1234/Bubblemon.app.

* Fix the copyright information you get if you right-click
  Bubblemon.app in the Finder and do "Get Info". It should be the same
  as what you get in the About box.

* Profile running on a really slow system
