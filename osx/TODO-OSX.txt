TODO
----
* Make the frame thinner and glossier

* Enable all warnings and warnings-as-errors.
 Don't know how, have asked:
 http://stackoverflow.com/q/26624470/473672

* Somehow make the Travis CI build run the self-checks that are built
  into Bubblemon.

* If Bubblemon.app has a file system timestamp later than when the
  Dock process started, then we should replace the running Bubblemon
  with ourselves. Nice during development.

* Add a dialog warning the user before we restart the Dock.

* If the Dock is at the bottom of the screen at installation, and
  we're on OSX10.9 or older, we should move it to the left, no
  questions asked.

* On OSX10.9 or older, if the user moves the Dock to the bottom, we
  should replace ourselves with a crossed over 1FPS Bubblemon. Then,
  if the user clicks us, we bring up a dialog offering to move the
  Dock back to the left.

* On OSX10.9 and older, Dock performance is about 4x worse when having
  the Dock at the bottom of the screen compared to running with the
  Dock to the left or right. Handle this.

* Think about using NSDefaults to query the Dock about our tile
  size. Maybe not every frame (for performance reasons), but every
  five seconds or so.


DONE
----
* Point the old web page to http://walles.github.io/bubblemon.

* Make sure http://walles.github.io/bubblemon has a link to
  https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases.

* Release zip files should go into ~/Downloads.

* Unzipping bubblemon-osx-1234.zip should give you the app in
  bubblemon-osx-1234/Bubblemon.app.

* Fix the copyright information you get if you right-click
  Bubblemon.app in the Finder and do "Get Info". It should be the same
  as what you get in the About box.

* Profile running on a really slow system

* Enable easy upgrades. If some other Bubblemon is running in the
  Dock, we should replace it with ourselves.

* Set up a Travis CI job analyzing OSX Debug for all pull requests and
  commits.

* Make sure Travis CI fails on Analyze warnings.

* Not our fault, didn't do anything: Deal with the timer syslog
  message that shows up every time Bubblemon has to install itself.

* Make a 1024x1024 app icon. This is a requirement for App Store
  release, and while releasing to App Store won't be possible we
  should follow their guidelines as well as we can. The icon should
  show up in the About box and when you look at Bubblemon.app in
  Finder.
