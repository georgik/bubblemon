TODO
----
* If $OLDVERSION is running and $NEWVERSION is launched, make sure $NEWVERSION
 replaces $OLDVERSION in the TouchBar

* TouchBar: Clicking Bubblemon should bring up the Activity Monitor

* TouchBar: Consider making the air transparent and changing the color scheme
 to better blend in with the other things on the TouchBar

* CI: Make sure CI fails if the code analysis finds problems

* Make the frame thinner and glossier

* Somehow make the Travis CI build run the self-checks that are built
  into Bubblemon.

* If Bubblemon.app has a file system timestamp later than when the
  Dock process started, then we should replace the running Bubblemon
  with ourselves. Nice during development.

* Think about using NSDefaults to query the Dock about our tile
  size. Maybe not every frame (for performance reasons), but every
  five seconds or so.


WONTFIX
-------
* Sign the app to remove the unknown-developer warning and to enable
  people to just double-click after download. This would cost me $99
  per year, which is just plain silly:
  https://developer.apple.com/support/compare-memberships/

* Enable all warnings and warnings-as-errors.
  Don't know how, have asked:

DONE
----
* Point the old web page to http://walles.github.io/bubblemon.

* Make sure http://walles.github.io/bubblemon has a link to
  https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases.

* Release zip files should go into ~/Downloads.

* Unzipping bubblemon-osx-1234.zip should give you the app in
  bubblemon-osx-1234/Bubblemon.app.

* Fix the copyright information you get if you right-click
  Bubblemon.app in the Finder and do "Get Info". It should be the same
  as what you get in the About box.

* Profile running on a really slow system

* Enable easy upgrades. If some other Bubblemon is running in the
  Dock, we should replace it with ourselves.

* Set up a Travis CI job analyzing macOS Debug for all pull requests and
  commits.

* Make sure Travis CI fails on Analyze warnings.

* Not our fault, didn't do anything: Deal with the timer syslog
  message that shows up every time Bubblemon has to install itself.

* Make a 1024x1024 app icon. This is a requirement for App Store
  release, and while releasing to App Store won't be possible we
  should follow their guidelines as well as we can. The icon should
  show up in the About box and when you look at Bubblemon.app in
  Finder.

* TouchBar: Make sure the .app has our icon

* TouchBar: Make sure the .app has the correct version when doing cmd-i in
 Finder

* TouchBar: Make sure the .app has the correct copyright when doing cmd-i in
 Finder

* TouchBar: Position the Bubblemon so it fills its allotted slot perfectly

* TouchBar: Figure out how to survive reboots

* TouchBar: When re-launched, pop up a dialog asking whether we should stay on
 the TouchBar or remove ourselves

* TouchBar: Add the TouchBar Bubblemon to the release zip file

* TouchBar: Give more pixels to the visualization by removing the frame

* TouchBar: Release a new Bubblemon with TouchBar support
