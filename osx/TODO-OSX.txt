TODO
----
* Think about making the frame thinner; would that look better?

* As a stop-gap solution for the icon in the About box, just put an
  empty image there instead of the stock icon.

* Make a 1024x1024 app icon. That's a requirement for App Store
  release, and while releasing to App Store won't be possible we
  should follow their guidelines as well as we can. The icon should
  show up in the About box and when you look at Bubblemon.app in
  Finder.

* Think about using NSDefaults to query the Dock about our tile
  size. Maybe not every frame (for performance reasons), but every
  five seconds or so.


DONE
----
* Point the old web page to http://walles.github.io/bubblemon.

* Make sure http://walles.github.io/bubblemon has a link to
  https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases.

* Release zip files should go into ~/Downloads.

* Unzipping bubblemon-osx-1234.zip should give you the app in
  bubblemon-osx-1234/Bubblemon.app.
