These instructions will tell you how to make an installation package
starting only from source code, and how to install that package.

These instructions have been tested on OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks with
Xcode version 6.0.1 (6A317).


Building and packaging
----------------------
* Install Xcode from the App Store.

* "open bubblemon.xcodeproj"

* Make sure you have the Bubblemon scheme selected (should be the
  default).

* Make sure you're doing a Release build:
  http://stackoverflow.com/a/18038359

* Press the Play button to build. After building is done, Bubblemon
  should start in your Dock.

* "cd ~/Downloads"

In this directory you'll find a bubblemon-osx-[version].zip file that
you can distribute to friends and family.


Installing
----------
* Double click the zip file in the Finder. This will create
  Bubblemon.app.

* Right click Bubblemon and choose "Open".

* Say yes to the security question (if any).

Bubblemon should now be running in your Dock.

Right click Bubblemon in the Dock and choose "Help" if you have
questions.
