These instructions will tell you how to make an installation package starting
only from source code, and how to install that package.

These instructions have been tested on OS X 10.12.6 El Capitan with Xcode
version 8.3.3 (8E3004b).


Making a Release
----------------
* "git tag" to show previous releases; release tags are the ones named
osx-versionnumber.

* "git tag --annotate osx-1.2.3" to tag version 1.2.3

* Run "./osx/makeDistZip.sh" to get a release zip file

* "git push --tags"

* Go to https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases and make a new release for
  the version you just tagged and built. Don't forget to upload the zip file.


Installing
----------
* Double click the zip file in the Finder. This will create
  Bubblemon.app.

* Right click Bubblemon and choose "Open".

* Say yes to the security question (if any).

Bubblemon should now be running in your Dock.

Right click Bubblemon in the Dock and choose "Help" if you have questions.
