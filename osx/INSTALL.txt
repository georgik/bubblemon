These instructions will tell you how to make an installation package
starting only from source code, and how to install that package.

These instructions have been tested on OS X 10.11.6 El Capitan with
Xcode version 7.3.1 (7D1014).


Building and Packaging
----------------------
* Install Xcode from the App Store.

* "open bubblemon.xcodeproj"

* Make sure you have the Release scheme selected (defaults to
  "Debug").

* Press the Play button to build. After building is done, Bubblemon
  should start in your Dock.

* "cd ~/Downloads"

In this directory you'll find a bubblemon-osx-[version].zip file that
you can distribute to friends and family.


Installing
----------
* Double click the zip file in the Finder. This will create
  Bubblemon.app.

* Right click Bubblemon and choose "Open".

* Say yes to the security question (if any).

Bubblemon should now be running in your Dock.

Right click Bubblemon in the Dock and choose "Help" if you have
questions.


Making a Release
----------------
* "git tag" to show previous releases; release tags are the ones named
osx-versionnumber.

* "git tag --annotate osx-1.2.3" to tag version 1.2.3

* "git push --tags"

* Follow the Building and Packaging instructions at the top of this
  document to get a binary zip file to distribute.

* Go to https://github.com/walles/bubblemon/releases and make a new
  release for the version you just tagged and built. Don't forget to
  upload the zip file.
