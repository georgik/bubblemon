These instructions will tell you how to make an installation package
starting only from source code, and how to install that package.

These instructions have been tested on OS X 10.9.5 Mavericks with
Xcode version 6.0.1 (6A317).


Building and packaging
----------------------
* Install Xcode from the App Store.

* open bubblemon.xcodeproj

* Make sure you have the Bubblemon Docked scheme selected (should be
  the default).

* Press the Play button to build. After building is done, Bubblemon
  should start in your Dock. Right click Bubblemon in the Dock and
  Quit it.

* cd ~/Library/Developer/Xcode/DerivedData

* If you do 'ls' here there should be a directory here called
  bubblemon-something. 'cd' into that directory. If you have several,
  do 'ls -l' and pick the newest one.

* cd Build/Products/Debug

* tar czf bubblemon-bin.tar.gz BubblemonDocked.app

You can now distribute bubblemon-bin.tar.gz to friends and family.


Installing
----------
* tar xf bubblemon-bin.tar.gz

* open BubblemonDockapp.app

* Right click the new entry in the Dock and check "Keep in Dock"

* Right click the new entry in the Dock and click "Quit"
